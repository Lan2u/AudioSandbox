# AudioSandbox
Messing around with audio files and audio data.

<h2>Goals</h2>
- To create a visual representation of the audio file as a set of images (Achieved < 12/11/2016)
- To create a real time representation (either displaying data point by data point or in small chunks)
- To play the sound at the same time
- To output the audio data in a nice-ish way that is easy to use for other things
- Create visual equalizers using the data output from above
- Create equalizers that actually edit the sound
